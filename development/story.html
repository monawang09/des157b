    <p>I updated the user journey to better fit the current project content. Through the user journey testing, I learned to narrow my focus of target audience. I initially wanted to design it as a monument for graduate international student to learn and leave a memory before they leave Davis, but I also had another idea to make it for freshmen students to learn about possible resources they have access to and learn  about the cultural environment and history in Davis. I think my user got confused when I show them my user journey. I would narrow my focus of user joruney to freshmen, sophomore and transfer international students that are new to the city of Davis.
