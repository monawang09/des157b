    <p> I think the main concern is that my user does not know how to interact with my
        interface. Regardless of its design, it is fundamentally a 3D interface and my user
        only develop exisitng mental models related to 2D designs (eg. a 2D button is for clicking) 
        Hence, it is important to provide clear instruction to navigate around the page.
