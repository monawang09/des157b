## Feature
- Image Recognition of the brick (Ar.js )
- Interactive modules about the brick (Vainlla Javascript)

Overall, I think the most important things for me to do this weekend is to test out Ar.js and whether if they work on image recognition. For the second feature about having interactive modules, the only thing I wold be needing is to learn about touch event. I planned on testing Ar.js during this weekend where I can code an example file and be physiclly present in downtown. However, I do recognie that this is a risky project idea, and here is my Plan B:
  
- Data visualization of the name on the bricks using three.js in web formatb  
- Users are able to upload their comment about the specific name or their thoughts on this space 

Plan B is highly doable within the scope of the current time. I think the only discrepency is that I am not that skilled in 3D design and three.js a harder library to work with. But I am really confident that I can make it work
