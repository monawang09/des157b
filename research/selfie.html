    <p>I am mostly interested in two aspects Related to the seal:</p>
    <p> The inner loop of the seal (pic3) mostly interests me by the revelation of the earliest settlers at Davis. I want to deepen my investigation about patwin traditions </p>
    <p> The bricks around the seal contains stories and memoies that are shared by the people of Davis collectively. How can I use an app asa creative medium that aid such story telling? </p>
