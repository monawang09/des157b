    <h1>Porposal: Interactive Bricks</h1>
    <div id="paragraph-formatter">
    <p>
        I am interested in working on creating an interactive app that help tourists to recognize the
        story behind the bricks around the seal and leave their memory about the individual or organization's name
        prescribed on the brick. This project is targeted towards tourists and people who grew and and live
        in Davis to read and share memories related to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is a mobile app incorporating onsite interactivity. Tourists can scan the names on the brick
        and there would be a pop-up window showing the story about the brick and a message board that leaves message
        about the owner of the brick (Or maybe compile a spotify playlist about the downtown scenery or songs)? I don't want to work with a partner on this project. In terms of challenges and reservations, I think using
        a Javascript library to scan and recognize names on the brick would certainly take some effort, but it shouldn't
        pose that big of a challenge once I found the correct library.
