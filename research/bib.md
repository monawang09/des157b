### Article 1: Project Brick Annotation

> Harsough, Rachel. "Project Brick Annotations." 15 April 2022, Microsoft Word document, 
    [https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/791790/pages/capstone-project-links-and-notes?module_item_id=1583431](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/791790/pages/capstone-project-links-and-notes?module_item_id=1583431).

This article is a great resource for my project as it includes annotations for 100 names around the bricks and a brief introduction about them. By putting these descriptions in the database, customers can learn more about the names of the bricks, which will save me a lot of effort. Rachel, one of the founders of the brick project, is an art and education specialist, and all of the annotations about the bricks are well-cited. Overall, this documentation is directly related to my research topic and I think it will be very useful for my project.


### Article 2: Davisville '68
> Hannibal, Mary Ellen. Davisville '68. University of Nebraska Press, 2009.

The main focus of "Davisville '68" is to provide insight into the social and political climate of Davis, California during the year 1968. This book is useful and relevant to my research topic as it sheds light on the historical context surrounding the events that occurred in Davis during that time. A special feature of the work that is unique and helpful is the detailed accounts of the protests and activism that took place in Davis in 1968, as well as the profiles of the individuals involved. The author, Mary Ellen Hannibal, is a reputable science and environmental writer, and has written for numerous publications including The New York Times and National Geographic. Hannibal's conclusion is that the events of 1968 in Davis had a significant impact on the city's future, particularly in terms of the development of the University of California, Davis. In my own observation, the book provides valuable information for my project, particularly in adding in-depth descriptions about the individuals and events mentioned on the bricks.

### Article 3: Localwiki
> UC-Davis LocalWiki contributors. "Davis Wiki." UC-Davis LocalWiki, 2023, https://localwiki.org/davis/.


The UC-Davis LocalWiki is a collaborative platform where residents and visitors can contribute information about the history, culture, and landmarks of Davis, California. For the Brick Project, this Wiki would be a valuable resource to gather information about the specific locations in Davis, including buildings and landmarks that may have a brick as well as the comments and opinions from local Davis resident. By utilizing this resource, the Brick Project could cross-reference their research and annotations and add on a less scholarly point of view just from local Davis resident. The project would then become a collective knowledge of the Davis community, incorporating academic research and local insights.
