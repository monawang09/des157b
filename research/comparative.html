    <h2> The Getty Museum App</h2>
    <p> The getty museum app allows user to explore the scenery with interactive audios.
        I can reference with the design of the app guide user through the whole tour in the museum but also granting
        then giving them the freedom of exploring separate section. I think the same idea could be 
        applied to my app too. Since many tuorists won't have prior knowledge related with Davis. Maybe setting
        up a tour would be a better idea

    <h2> The National Park Service App</h2>
    <p> The National Park Service provides interactive map that highlight hiking trail, point of view, and many other features of the app.
        I think the user interface from their sample posess a great value towards my design. The designs are not only clear
        and succients, but also clearly displays the story and the content.
